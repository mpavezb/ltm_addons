# ltm_addons ROS package

Generic plugins and episodic interfaces for the ROS Long Term Memory (LTM) suite. This package provides the **ImageStream** plugin, which collects images from topics bases on 'sensor_msgs/Image' messages. Also, an **episodic interface between SMACH and the LTM server** is provided, which can collect episodes from each state from a running state machine.

The LTM documentation can be located in the [repository of the ltm ROS package](https://github.com/mpavezb/ltm).
